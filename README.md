# skills plugin for WP

This plugin allows the user to create a custom 'overview' post type which can be assigned to any page or post.

Users can use the skill label shortcode which looks like "[skill-label id=666]" and add this to their page.

This plugin is forked from the Easy Nutrition Facts Label plugin found at https://en-gb.wordpress.org/plugins/easy-nutrition-facts-label/

2. Activate the plugin through the Plugins menu in WordPress

3. Create a label in the new 'Labels' section of the admin.

4. Include the shortcode [skill-label id=666] where you want a specific label to be displayed.
